# SQL Portfolio – Relational Data Analysis

This folder contains SQL queries demonstrating proficiency with
relational databases, aggregation logic, joins, date handling,
and formatted analytical outputs.

The examples are based on simulated academic and retail-style datasets
designed to mirror real-world reporting and analytics use cases.

---

## SQL Concepts Demonstrated

- SELECT statements
- WHERE filtering
- NULL handling
- LIKE, BETWEEN, and IN operators
- ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT
- Column and table aliases
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, AVG)
- GROUP BY and HAVING
- INNER JOINs across related tables
- Date and scalar functions (EXTRACT, CURRENT_DATE)
- Human-readable output formatting using CONCAT

---

## Datasets

The queries operate on structured relational datasets including:

- students
- grades
- faculty
- products
- categories

These tables represent common relational patterns such as
one-to-many relationships, foreign keys, and time-based records.

Synthetic datasets are used to demonstrate logic without relying
on proprietary or sensitive data.

  - Aggregations and joins across students and grades
- `date_filtering_examples.sql`
  - Birth date filtering and dynamic date logic

## Notes

This portfolio focuses on query clarity, correctness,
and analytical reasoning rather than platform-specific syntax.
